									<p>It started with a great cup of coffee, as many success stories do.</p>
									<p>In 1886, the prestigious Hotel Del Monte in Monterey, California introduced the world to Del Monte Coffee, a premium coffee specifically blended for hotel guests. The coffee must have been potent, because the company quickly grew to a globally recognized brand with a reputation for high standards and fair practices.</p>
									<p>Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., Inc. delivers whole fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh-cut produce and packaged fresh produce-based products to people across North America under the Del Monte<sup>&reg;</sup> brand.</p>

									<p>Life today can be, shall we say, hectic. It seems like it keeps getting harder to make positive choices that support your wellbeing. Too bad you can’t just download fruit salad (maybe one day—we might even have someone working on that).</p>
									<p>Anyway, our goal is to bring a little more fresh into your life through wholesome and convenient products. And that’s why we are constantly looking for ways to make it easier for you to add fresh produce to your diet. We’re full-service fresh, with whole fresh produce, ready-to-eat fresh-cut options when you’re on the go, and packaged fresh produce-based options that make eating healthfully nice and simple.</p>
									<p>So whenever you see fresh fruits and veggies sporting the tri-color Del Monte<sup>&reg;</sup> shield, you have the peace of mind that comes with making a wholesome choice. And fortunately, we always find that one of those always leads to another.</p>
